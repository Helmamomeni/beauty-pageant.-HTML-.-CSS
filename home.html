                            <p>Make-up is the normal facial makeup that is used to correct possible facial defects and increase beauty. Unlike make-up, which uses light and dark shadow techniques to modify the face, make-up does this only with colors. In fact, makeup does not emphasize the forms and only adds color to the face.</p>

                            <p>If you look up the word chignon in the dictionary, you will come across the word "hair bun". Its meaning in hairdressing is that the hair is tied from the back of the head or top with a special shape and model.

                                In the past, this method was limited to only one model, and that was gathering and tying the hair from the back of the head in a simple and common way. But today, chignon has become an art and technique in hair styling. So that professional hairdressers show and flaunt a large part of their hairdressing art in this way.</p>
